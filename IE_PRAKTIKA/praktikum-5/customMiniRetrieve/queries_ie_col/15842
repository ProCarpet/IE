    of journals in libraries (any types of library), both current
    and back issues. i am also interested in information on the
    ways in which libraries have coped with cuts in periodicals
    budgets. periodicals, journals, libraries, user studies, cuts
    in public libraries, academic libraries, university libraries,
    polytechnic libraries, higher education libraries.
