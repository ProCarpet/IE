i am interested in information policy, e.g. national
    (including those of national 'centres' and 'foci'), scientific
    and technological (in medicine, industry, agriculture). sources
    may include various professional bodies, parliamentary
    committees, counterparts in other countries, such as the
    various presidential committees in the usa, national centres,
    and, of course, those of international 'conferences' and bodies
    such as unesco. i am more interested in implementation than in
    paper declarations which are not backed up by sufficient
    resources. planning, aims and objectives, government,
    international, policy, information policy, national policies,
    cooperation.
