i am doing a study of the librarian's christian
    fellowship from a professional angle. i am looking for
    literature which reflects a distinctly christian view of
    librarianship, particularly prior to 1973. anything on the
    historical development of the librarian's christian fellowship
    would be of interest. also coverage of the group in the
    professional press since 1973, including their pronouncements
    and views of members and non-members of christian activity and
    attitudes in the profession (especially subjects like ethics,
    censorship, selection etc.). christian, evangelical, ethics,
    censorship, librarian's christian fellowship, lcf.
