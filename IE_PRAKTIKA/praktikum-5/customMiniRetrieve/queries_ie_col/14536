i am interested in information and less developed
    countries. this would include the particular problems of less
    developed countries now, and their expected future problems
    (such as electronic publishing). also, the information policies
    of less developed countries and the factors which may affect
    their practical implementation. what are the priorities and
    suggested practical stages in the solution of problems and
    implementation of policies. less developed countries, under
    developed countries, developing countries.
