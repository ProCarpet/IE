i'd like to find articles describing the use of singular
    value decomposition in digital image processing. applications
    include finding approximations to the original image and
    restoring images that are subject to noise. an article on the
    subject is h.c. andrews and c.l. patterson "outer product
    expansions and their uses in digital image processing",
    american mathematical monthly, vol. 82.
