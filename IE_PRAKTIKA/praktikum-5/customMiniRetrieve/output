Querrie = fast algorithm for context-free language recognition or    parsing
an efficient context-free parsing algorithm a parsing
    algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general
    context-free algorithm known is described. it is similar to
    both knuth's lr(k) algorithm and the familiar top-down
    algorithm. it has a time bound proportional to n^3 (where n is
    the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has a n^2
    bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a
    large class of grammars, which seems to include most practical
    context-free programming language grammars. in an empirical
    comparison it appears to be superior to the top-down and
    bottom-up algorithms studied by griffiths and petrick.

Querrie = fast algorithm for context-free language recognition or    parsing
on the relative efficiencies of context-free grammar
    recognizers a number of diverse recognition procedures that
    have been proposed for parsing sentences with respect to a
    context-free grammar are described in this paper by means of a
    common device. each procedure is defined by giving an algorithm
    for obtaining a nondeterministic turing machine recognizer that
    is equivalent to a given context-free grammar. the
    formalization of the turing machine has been chosen to make
    possible particularly simple description of the parsing
    procedures considered. an attempt has been made to compare
    recognition efficiencies for the procedures defined. for a few
    simple grammars and sentences a formal comparison has been
    made. empirical comparison of the recognition of more realistic
    programming languages such as lisp and algol has been made by
    means of a program which simulates the turing machine on the
    univac m-460 computer. several algorithms for producing
    grammars equivalent to a given context-free grammar have been
    considered, and the increase in recognition efficiency they
    afford has been empirically investigated. may, 1965 griffiths,

Querrie = fast algorithm for context-free language recognition or    parsing
context-sensitive parsing this paper presents a canonical
    form for context-sensitive derivations and a parsing algorithm
    which finds each context-sensitive analysis once and only once.
    the amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially
    no more than the required to store a single complete
    derivation. in addition, a modified version of the basic
    algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for
    grammars which contain loops. the algorithm is also compared
    with several previous parsers for context-sensitive grammars
    and general rewriting systems, and the difference between the
    two types of analyses is discussed. the algorithm appears to be
    complementary to an algorithm by s. kuno in several respects,
    including the space-time trade-off and the degree of context
    dependence involved. july, 1970 woods, w. a. context-sensitive

Querrie = addressing schemes for resources in networks; resource    addressing in network operating systems
capability-based addressing various addressing schemes
    making use of segment tables are examined. the inadequacies of
    these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are explained.
    these inadequacies are traced to the lack of an efficient
    absolute address for objects in these systems. the direct use
    of a capability as an address is shown to overcome these
    difficulties because it provides the needed absolute address.
    implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed. it
    is predicted that the use of tags to identify capabilities will
    dominate. a hardware address translation scheme which never
    requires the modification of the representation of capabilities
    is suggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table for
    obtaining a segment's location in main memory given its unique
    code. the hash table is avoided for recently accessed segments
    by means of a set of associative registers. a computer using
    capability-based addressing may be substantially superior to
    present systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of
    programming conventions, and efficient implementation. july,

a process for the determination of addresses in variable
    length addressing an algorithm is presented for the assignment
    of instruction addresses and formats under the following
    conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies as a
    function of the distance of the instruction from its target;
    (2) there exists an optimality criterion which implies some
    preferential choices subject to the addressing constraints.
    this may be, for example, achieving the smallest number of long
    instructions, in which case the total code length is minimized,
    or minimizing the assigned address of a specified point in the
    program. the algorithm is suitable for arbitrary program
    structure and a choice of optimization criteria. june, 1976

how to keep the addresses short an algorithm is presented
    for minimizing the sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding
    produced by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of
    each computer instruction is assumed to be either "long" or
    "short" ("long," if the memory location addressed is more than
    a predetermined distance from the current location; "short,"
    otherwise), and (2) there are blocks of instructions whose
    beginnings (origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. for
    example, some computers permit either 8-bit addressing
    (interpreted relative to the location counter) or full 16-bit
    addressing of all of memory. when assembling or compiling two
    or more blocks of instructions which have many mutual
    references in such a computer, there is no simple iterative
    procedure for keeping as many of the addresses short as
    possible. this paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems
    of this type can be formulated as covering problems solvable by
    means of elementary arithmetic operations on the column vectors
    of a ternary matrix. may, 1971 richards, d. l. addressing,

    soon became available for use on the range of minicomputers
    which had started to penetrate the market. many were specially
    commissioned for library and information use; discusses cairs
    and status. a major breakthrough came with the introduction of
    word processors, particularly the programmable shared logic
    systems. manufacturers started to produce specific software
    packages, including information storage and retrieval programs,
    for this type of equipment. examples of relevant hardware and
    software and various applications are given.
