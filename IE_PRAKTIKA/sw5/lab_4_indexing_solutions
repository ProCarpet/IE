Exercise 1)
    b)
    Term count before stopword english 10164
    Term count after english stopword  9811 
    Total stopwords removed 353.
    a)
    Terms before stemming 9811
    Terms after stemming  7198
    The number of unique terms is 2613 smaler than before this is most likely the result of words based on the same 
    base beeing reduced to the same stem. Like plurals and singular version of a word form the same base. Also a few
    different words will resullt in the same stemmed base this is not optimal.

Exercise 2) 
    a)
    256 Documents
    b)
    I think not as we most likely wanted to know more about fluid density as metric not its application in a specific field.
    c)
    Yes the second one is relevant. 
    d)
    Yes the most relevant documents chane and I think they are more relevant with BM25

Exercise 3) 
    a)
    I would use the querry: "experimental hypersonic" and two terms found only in document one or document two respectivly
    so if both show up its and. 
    The number of found documents increases when i use both instead of only one querry meaning it searches for either or. 
    b)
    I would say it would degarde precision. 
    c)
    ii
    d)
    ii finds more documents
    i finds proably more relevant documents as it contains more of the querry. 

Exercise 4)
    a) 
    olive not stemmed = 0
    olive stemmed     = 2
    b)
    No neither even contain the word olive 
    c)
    An unsuccesfull stemming as some different terms than olive got mapped to the same base.
    d) 
    (1) = true / (2) = false / (3) = false / (4) = true / (5) = false(homonyme) / (6) = true 

Exercise 5) 
    a) 
    i) it did not work
    ii) we can not they stem to the same base
    b) 
    i can exclude terms or weight them negatively whilst ii can only emphasize terms.

Exercise 6)
    a) without stopword elimination the top doesn't change at all. (with stopword elimination the would be striped from the querry)
    b) it is still neccessary to reduce the calculation and indexing load. 
    c) 1201
    d) 1291 yes it does unexpectedly 
    e) 1201 it matches the first querry surprisingly
    f) the top results change between "the" and "the jet"
       top results bm25 jet       = 997, 695, 1195
       top results bm25 the jet   = 350, 973, 997
       top results tfidf jet      = 695, 1195, 997
       top results tfidf the jet  = 695, 1195, 997
       2 of the top 3 results the same across 3 querrys and one is found in every querry. I dont know why. 
    g) I can see the value in certain stop words especially in combination with other words but i fail to see the value 
       having stopwords in a bag of random words from a querry dissconeceted from each other. 

Exercise 7) 
    a) zurich : df=2 cf=2
       zero : df=137 cf= 198
    b) 139 (querry zurich)
    c) 0 else the df's would not add up to the combined querry 
    d) wave = 168, wavelength = 6 , (wave wavelength) = 172
       (168+6)-172= 4 
       4 documents contain both
    e) air = 189 , wing = 181, aircraft = 77
       containing: air^wing!aircraft = (air + wing- air^wing)- (air + aircraft - air ^ aircraft) - (wing aircraft) 
       (189+181-357) - (189+77- 251) - 
       (13)-(15)-()
       //todo

Exercise 8) 
    i) unmodulated no stopword no stemming = 2 documents 
       unmodulated in index df=2 cf=3 
       unmodulated found in documents 3 times 
       it uses term count most likely. 
    ii) nothing would change.
    iii) the frequenzy would go up with a stopword remover. 

Exercise 9) 
    a) 466
    b) 433
    c) 466
    d) it is working correctly 433 only contains "wing" and 466 contains "vapor" and "wing" 
       so it will show up with both querrys at the top. The top result for aircraft doesnt contain wing or air indicating 
       there is no overlap between wing and aircraft. Aircraft and air also have no overlap in the top document of air.
