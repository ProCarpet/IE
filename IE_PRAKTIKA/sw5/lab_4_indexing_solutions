Exercise 1)
    b)
    Term count before stopword english 10164
    Term count after english stopword  9811 
    Total stopwords removed 353.
    a)
    Terms before stemming 9811
    Terms after stemming  7198
    The number of unique terms is 2613 smaler than before this is most likely the result of words based on the same 
    base beeing reduced to the same stem. Like plurals and singular version of a word form the same base. Also a few
    different words will resullt in the same stemmed base this is not optimal.

Exercise 2) 
    a)
    256 Documents
    b)
    I think not as we most likely wanted to know more about fluid density as metric not its application in a specific field.
    c)
    Yes the second one is relevant. 
    d)
    Yes the most relevant documents chane and I think they are more relevant with BM25

Exercise 3) 
    a)
    I would use the querry: "experimental hypersonic" and two terms found only in document one or document two respectivly
    so if both show up its and. 
    The number of found documents increases when i use both instead of only one querry meaning it searches for either or. 
    b)
    I would say it would degarde precision. 
    c)
    ii
    d)
    ii finds more documents
    i finds proably more relevant documents as it contains more of the querry. 

Exercise 4)
    a) 
    olive not stemmed = 0
    olive stemmed     = 2
    b)
    No neither even contain the word olive 
    c)
    An unsuccesfull stemming as some different terms than olive got mapped to the same base.
    d) 
    (1) = true / (2) = false / (3) = false / (4) = true / (5) = false(homonyme) / (6) = true 

Exercise 5) 
    a) 
    i) it did not work
    ii) we can not they stem to the same base
    b) 
    i can exclude terms or weight them negatively whilst ii can only emphasize terms.
